# DSO1-BasketballSystem

###  This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Systems Development I course at UFSC, in collaboration with Davi Chiquetti. The goal is to create a system for managing basketball tournaments for a university organization, using the MVC architectural pattern in Python.

# Project Structure
## The project is organized into three main directories, each representing a part of the MVC pattern:

- Entity: This directory contains classes that represent the system's main entities, such as players, teams, games, and tournaments. These classes encapsulate the data and behavior related to these entities.

- View: This is where the files responsible for user interaction and data presentation are located. This includes graphical interfaces, if needed, or any other means of communication between the system and the end-user.

- Controller: This directory holds the classes that act as system controllers. They are responsible for receiving user input, coordinating the necessary actions, and updating the model and/or the view accordingly.
